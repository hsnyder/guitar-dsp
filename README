A personal project - digital effects for the electric guitar, intended to be run on a raspberry pi equipped with a sound card. 

- Requires the apt package 'libasound2-dev' on raspbian
- Requires an ALSA compatible sound card
- Uses DrWav for .wav file handling: https://mackron.github.io/dr_wav

Implemented effects are:
- Biquad filtering
- Convolution (intended to be used with a guitar speaker impulse response)
- Delay (echo)
- Chorus / flanging
- Tremolo

The project uses explicit arm-specific SIMD intrinsics and as such is not portable.
